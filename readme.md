# FEUP-CPAR

Repository to hold all work done in the Parallel Computing course (CPAR) taught at FEUP. Work done by @rendoir and @cyrilico.

The first work analyzes the performance of a single core in various versions of the matrix multiplication algorithm.
The second work studies different parallelization techniques (shared, distributed and hybrid memory) applied to a well known algorithm, the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
